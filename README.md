# Terraform Architecture for Startup Deployment
# Overview

This repository contains the Terraform scripts necessary to deploy a comprehensive cloud architecture tailored for startup environments. This architecture is designed to provide scalability, flexibility, and security for your startup's infrastructure.

# Features

Multi-Cloud Support: This Terraform configuration is compatible with major cloud providers including AWS, Azure, and GCP, allowing you to choose the platform that best suits your requirements.

Modular Design: The architecture is structured in modules, enabling easy customization and adaptation to your specific needs. Each module focuses on a specific aspect, such as compute, networking, databases, and more.

High Availability: The architecture is designed with redundancy and fault tolerance in mind, ensuring that your services remain available even in the event of hardware or software failures.

Security Best Practices: Security is a paramount concern. This configuration includes best practices for network segmentation, encryption, and identity management to safeguard your startup's sensitive data.

Automated Scaling: Auto-scaling configurations are included to dynamically adjust resources based on demand, optimizing costs and performance.


# Getting Started

Prerequisites: Ensure you have the necessary credentials and permissions for your chosen cloud provider(s). Install Terraform on your local machine.

Customization: Review and modify the variables.tf file to tailor the configuration to your startup's specific requirements, adjusting parameters such as region, instance types, and network settings.

Deployment: Execute the Terraform commands to create and manage your infrastructure. Refer to the provided documentation for detailed instructions.

# Directory Structure

modules/: Contains individual modules for different components (e.g., compute, networking, databases).

variables.tf: Defines the variables used in the configuration. Modify these according to your startup's needs.

main.tf: Orchestrates the deployment of various modules.

outputs.tf: Specifies the values to be displayed after a successful deployment.

terraform.tfvars.example: Example file for storing sensitive variables (e.g., API keys, secrets).
